# BVPSolver
This is a personal project inspired by PINN(Physics-Informed Neural Net)(https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs).

The objective is to design a NN to 1.solve a BVP(Boundary Value Problem).
                                   2.estimate the coeff. of BVP
                                   
The example problem is from my FEM(Finite Element Method) testbook.
